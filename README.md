##Index
[Project Overview](https://github.com/antoinesylvia/dallas_diecast_labs/blob/main/README.md#project-overview)


## Project Overview
This project implements an automated 6 lane racetrack system for diecast vehicles 1/64 scale, featuring real-time race management, result tracking, audio-visual feedback and more. The track operates outdoors under a covered roof in Dallas, Texas. The system is comprised of an automated start gate (using Lego motors which uses a Raspberry Pi Build HAT), a checkpoint gate (bottom of the incline, powered via a Raspberry Pi), a finish gate with light sensors (powered by a Tiny Lenovo ThinkCentre, but can be swap out for a Pi), a central server (serves as the brain of the operation, handles the coordination and race event state between the start gate and finish gate), audio manager (plays various sounds based on race state) and a web control interface ran locally. 

The offshoot of putting this project together, is build an engaging system that can teach children about science. The following will be appended to our main dashboard when completed:
- Phase 1: Time, speed and distance (measured). [Currently Testing]
- Phase 2: Gravitational Acceleration (incline drop)Â and Linear Acceleration (straightaway between checkpoint and finish gate). [Planned]
- Phase 3: Potential Energy, Work Done, ForcePower, Force and G-Force. [Planned]
- Phase 4: Energy Efficiency, Coefficient of Restitution, Heat Generation, Impulse & Jerk, and Terminal Velocity. [Planned]

- Modern Ethernet ports support Auto-MDI/MDIX, which automatically detects and configures the connection type (straight-through or crossover) needed for the link.
- Static IP addresses are assigned to both devices to ensure consistent connectivity.

### Configuration
- **Raspberry Pi**: 192.168.1.2 (example IP)
- **Lenovo ThinkCentre**: 192.168.1.1 (example IP)
- **Subnet mask**: 255.255.255.0
- **No default gateway needed** for this direct connection

## Project - Setup and Deployment
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure `config.py` for your environment
4. Run the central server: `python app.py`
5. Start the finish gate script: `python finish_gate.py`
6. Start the start gate script: `python start_gate.py`
7. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:5000` (or configured HOST:PORT)

#### Order of Opening Programs
1. Central Server
2. Finish Gate
3. Start Gate

This order ensures that the central server is ready to receive connections from both gates.

#### Initialization Process (1st run and subsequent runs)
1. Central server starts and enters the 'Initialization' state.
2. Finish gate connects and reports its component status.
3. Start gate connects and reports its component status.
4. Once both gates have reported OK status, the central server transitions to the 'Ready' state.
5. The start gate then waits for user input (button press) to begin the race.

For subsequent runs, the reset button is used to return to the 'Initialization' state and begin this process again.

## Testing
- Set `INITIAL_RACE_IN_PROGRESS = True` in `config.py` for isolated finish gate testing
- Use `TEST_MODE = True` for full system testing without physical hardware
- Run `sensor_calibration.py` to calibrate light sensors and adjust `LIGHT_SENSOR_THRESHOLD`
- Implement specific test modes for Start Gate mechanism and countdown sequence

## Testing Modes
- TEST_MODE for running the system without physical hardware
- Sensor calibration tool doubles as a testing utility for finish detection

## Configuration Management Web Interface
- Dynamic Web Interface: A user-friendly web interface for viewing and modifying configuration settings in real-time, without the need to restart the application.
- Database-Driven Configuration: All configuration values are stored in a SQLite database, allowing for persistent changes and easy retrieval across application restarts.
- Dual-Source Configuration:
	- config.py serves as the initial template and fallback for default values if a "reset" is called. 
	- The database acts as the source of truth once the config.py file is imported, reflecting the most up-to-date configuration.
- Flexible Initialization Options:
	- Automatic Database Initialization: On first run, the system automatically populates the database with default values from config.py, ensuring a smooth setup process.
	- Command-Line Reset: Option to reset the database to default values from config.py using a command-line argument (e.g., python central_server.py -config).
- Automatic Database Initialization: On first run, the system automatically populates the database with default values from config.py, ensuring a smooth setup process.
- Adaptive Configuration Management:
	- Automatic detection and addition of new configuration keys from config.py on each application boot.
	- Ensures backwards compatibility and easy integration of new features.
- Real-Time Updates: Changes made through the web interface are immediately reflected in the running application, providing instant feedback and eliminating the need for manual restarts.

## Error Handling and Logging
- Comprehensive error handling across all components
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting and system monitoring
- Component status updates are regularly sent to the Central Server

## Troubleshooting
- Check console outputs for error messages and logs
- Use the web interface to monitor system status and component health
- For audio issues, verify system volume and presence of audio files
- Run sensor calibration tool if finish detection becomes unreliable

## Maintenance
- Regularly check and clean light sensors for accurate detection
- Ensure all cable connections are secure
- Update firmware on microcontrollers as needed
- Periodically test and calibrate the start gate mechanism
- Run sensor calibration tool to maintain optimal `LIGHT_SENSOR_THRESHOLD`

## Finish Gate Threshold Behavior:
- If USE_ADAPTIVE_THRESHOLD is False: System uses the static LIGHT_SENSOR_THRESHOLD value.
- If USE_ADAPTIVE_THRESHOLD is True and USE_DYNAMIC_THRESHOLD is False: #   System uses the percentage-based light reduction method (LIGHT_REDUCTION_PERCENTAGE).
- If both USE_ADAPTIVE_THRESHOLD and USE_DYNAMIC_THRESHOLD are True: System uses a dynamic threshold calculation (mean - (sensitivity * standard deviation)).
- BASELINE_SAMPLES determines how many recent light readings are used to calculate the baseline light level. Higher values make the system more stable but slower to adapt.
- This sampling happens automatically and quickly before each race and between races.

## Race Timing System
1. Race Initiation: Start Gate lifts the lever and signals the Central Server
2. Timer Start: Central Server starts the race timer
3. Ongoing Race: Central Server continues timing
4. Finish Detection: Finish Gate detects cars crossing finish line
5. Finish Time Recording: Central Server records finish times via Finish Gate (using thousandths of a second (milliseconds) precision)
6. Race Completion: All cars finish or timeout is reached
7. Results Processing: Central Server calculates final times, positions, and speeds
8. Results Distribution: Web Interface displays results, database stores them

## Race State Management
- The system uses a state machine approach with defined valid transitions between states.
- States include: Initialization, Ready, Countdown, Racing, Placement, Finished, Intermission, and Reset.
- Each state transition triggers specific actions and audio cues.
- All races completed are captured and numbered sequentially in the database. 
- State transition edge cases: Timeout logic to ensure no state persists for too long.

## Race State Event List 
1. Initialization: Perform checks on all components to ensure readiness.
2. Ready: All systems are ready for the race to begin.
3. Countdown: Initiate the countdown sequence: 3, 2, 1.
4. Racing: The gate is activated, and cars are moving down the track.
5. Placement: Determine the order of finish from 1st to 6th; cars that don't finish within 3 seconds are marked as crashed or non-participating.
6. Finished: The race has concluded.
7. Intermission: Await reset to prepare for the next race.
8. Reset: Reset the track, cars, and system for the next race.

## Kinetic Energy Measurement [Optional]
- A user has the option to enter the weight of their vehicle once the race concludes for results (lane, speed, time) via the web interface.
- The kinetic energy calculates on the client side using a JavaScript function "if" weight is provided by a user, then it is immediately displayed and sent to the central server. 
- The database can handle races with or without weight and kinetic energy data.
- The UI currently displays 'N/A' for kinetic energy when weight is not provided (subject to change).

## Momentum Measurement [Optional]
- A user has the option to enter the weight of their vehicle once the race concludes for results (lane, speed, time) via the web interface.
- Momentum is calculated on the client side using a JavaScript function. If weight is provided by a user, momentum is immediately calculated, displayed, and sent to the central server.
- The calculation uses the formula: Momentum = mass * velocity, where mass is derived from the entered weight, and velocity is the recorded speed of the vehicle.
- The central server and database are designed to handle races with or without weight and momentum data, maintaining compatibility with races where this information is not provided.
- In the UI, momentum is displayed as 'N/A' when weight is not entered, ensuring clarity for users (this display method may be subject to future updates).
- This feature complements the existing Kinetic Energy measurement, providing users with additional physics-based insights into their vehicle's performance.

## Database Management
- SQLite database for storing race results and component statuses
- Automatic creation of necessary tables on first run
- Queries for detecting new records and managing race history

## Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Use of os.path.join for file path management
- Pygame for cross-platform audio playback
- Web interface for platform-independent race monitoring and control

## Temperature and Humidity Monitoring:
   - Weather information section that fetches and displays this data on our dashboard via a periodic OpenWeatherMap API call.
